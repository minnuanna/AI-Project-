Greetings from the intersection of bustling urban streets and advanced artificial intelligence! This research explores how reinforcement learning can revolutionize the taxi industry. Imagine a world where taxis operate with remarkable efficiency, responding to traffic in real time, selecting the best routes, and delivering exceptional passenger experiences. This innovation not only reshapes the taxi service industry but also supports sustainability, reduces urban congestion, and enhances city safety. Join us as we examine how intelligent algorithms can tackle the complexities of urban transportation, transforming taxi driving into a smarter, more adaptable profession that benefits both drivers and riders.

In todayâ€™s competitive taxi sector, drivers often manage to secure a consistent number of ride requests throughout the day. However, many face the challenge of stagnant profits despite rising revenues, largely due to increasing fuel and energy costs. Making thoughtful decisions about which rides to accept is crucial for maximizing earnings. Our study focuses on helping drivers enhance their profitability through reinforcement learning-based solutions.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning system that empowers drivers to make smarter, real-time decisions, ultimately boosting their daily earnings.

Example Scenario

Picture a driver at 3 PM receiving three ride options. The first is a long trip offering a high fare but ends in a low-demand area, reducing the chances of another ride soon. The second leads to a better location but requires a detour for passenger pickup, raising fuel costs. The third is a moderate trip that keeps the driver in a high-demand zone with minimal traffic, increasing the likelihood of quickly securing another ride. Choosing the third ride would likely maximize efficiency, balancing earnings and operational costs while positioning the driver for future opportunities.
